1 - Pulse-code Modulation (PCM)

A short demo of PCM with u-Law companding. Run "pcm_main.m"

2 - Differential PCM (DPCM)

Implementation of DPCM as in Ingle, V. and Proakis, J., 2015. Digital signal processing using MATLAB. 4th ed. p.591.
Run "dpcm_main.m" and record your voice for 3 seconds and your sound will be compressed.

3 - Fuzzy k-means clustering

Operates on 2D data.

4 - Linear Predictive Coding

Demo for LPC speech compression.

5 - FIR Filter Design by Frequency Domain Sampling

A demo for this type of filter design.
