Function takes 3 inputs: (input_objects,m,cluster_number). "input_objects" is 2 x M matrix where first column
is x coordinates and second column is y coordinates of data. Data consists of M points on 2-dimensional plane. "m"
is the hyperparameter that controls fuzzyness. "cluster_number" is the number of clusters to which user wants to
divide the data.
